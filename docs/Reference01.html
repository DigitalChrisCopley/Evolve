        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph which has been added using Visual Studio Code on the laptop. GitHub Desktop has been installed and used to clone the repository. Next steps are how to merge the downloaded repository with the online version.</p>
        <p>I'm going to save this then preview the Sandbox Workspace where Reference01.html is embedded. I don't expect an immediate update but I can refresh that page after each upcoming action to see which action causes the udpate.</p>
