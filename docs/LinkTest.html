<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When&nbsp;working from home the preferred and most reliable method is for your&nbsp;Council laptop to be connected directly to your&nbsp;router via a network cable (hardwired).&nbsp; If this is not logistically possible, IT Services recommend the use of an Ethernet over Power adaptor. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The adaptor provides simplicity and reliability that wireless technology still can't match. It's not designed to replace a Wi-Fi network, it's supposed to complement one.&nbsp; You will need a plug socket near your router and close to where you are working. Further information can be found in the <a title="Ethernet over power adaptor" href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Ethernet%20over%20Power%20adaptor.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethernet over Power adaptor</a>&nbsp;guidance.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When logging on to the Council network from home for the first time you will need to connect your laptop directly to your home Wi-Fi internet provider (IP) address.&nbsp;Once you have hardwired your laptop or connected to your home Wi-Fi, you will need to log in. How you connect to your home Wi-Fi and log in&nbsp;depends upon which device you have. Information&nbsp;on how to establish which device you have can be found in the identify my device guidance.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Once you have identified your device you will need to connect to your Wi-Fi and log in. If you have a Workspace laptop instructions can be found in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Connecting%20to%20your%20home%20Wi-Fi.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connecting to your Wi-Fi-</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Logging%20in%20from%20home%20-%20workspace.docx">log</a><a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Logging%20in%20from%20home%20-%20workspace.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ging in from home workspace</a> guidance. If your laptop is a non workspace device then you can find guidance in the logging in from home for a <a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Win%207%20laptop%2c%20logging%20in%20from%20home.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 7</a> or for a <a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Win%2010%20laptop%2c%20logging%20in%20from%20home.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 10</a> laptop.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">If you are working remotely and have no Wi-Fi connection, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot on your Council smartphone and tether your Workspace laptop directly to your phone. Information on how to create a Wi-Fi hotspot can be found in the <a href="http://intranet.bradford.gov.uk/docs/Documents/Smartphone%20Wi-fi%20hotspot.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smartphone Wi-Fi hotspot </a>guidance (this only works for Workspace laptops).&nbsp;</span></div>
