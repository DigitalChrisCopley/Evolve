                <p>
                    Microsoft Teams has many great functions including, video
                    conference, voice conference, chat facilities, file share,
                    collaboration, white boarding etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To support the accelerated rollout of teams in phase one, we will
                    only be enabling video, voice and chat functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additional functionality will be added in due course.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Teams Fast Track</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>In agreement with Council Management Team IT Services has been fast
                    tracking the implementation of Microsoft Teams with
                    support of key suppliers e.g. Microsoft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of a “Fast Track approach” it is possible that some users
                    will experience disruption to service <i>(by this we
                        <b>don’t</b> mean key systems will fail)</i>, please see example
                    below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example; some customers have access to be able to use the “Send
                    from” function, when sending emails from another
                    mail box. This functionality may not work immediately as we migrate
                    customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers will still have access to read and view emails in these
                    additional mailboxes and access will be restored
                    during the migration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> If we were to try and unpick the complexity of how our
                    systems have been created in the past to ensure there was
                    no disruption to service (as detailed above), it would take 3 months
                    of analysis, and changes before being able to make
                    headway for over 2,000 Customers to be able to have Microsoft Teams.
