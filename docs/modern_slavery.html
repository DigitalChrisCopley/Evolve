                    This information is taken directly from the <a
                        href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/community-safety/modern-slavery" target="_blank">LGA

                <p>
                    The term ‘Modern Slavery' captures a whole range of types of exploitation, many of which occur
                    together. These include
                    but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sexual exploitation</li>
                    <li>domestic servitude</li>
                    <li>forced labour</li>
                    <li>criminal exploitation</li>
                    <li>other forms of exploitation: organ removal; forced begging; forced benefit fraud; forced
                        marriage and illegal adoption.
                </ul>

                <h2>The role of councils</h2>
                <p>Councils have a key role to play in tackling modern slavery, including in identifying and supporting
                    victims and working
                    in partnership locally. Councils' role can be separated into four distinct areas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>identification and referral of victims</li>
                    <li>supporting victims – this can be through safeguarding children and adults with care and support
                        needs
                        and through housing/homelessness services</li>
                    <li>community safety services and disruption activities</li>
                    <li>ensuring that the supply chains councils procure from are free from modern slavery.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Modern slavery intersects with many different areas that councils are involved with and a number of
                    different officers
                    might come across it while going about their everyday activities. Key examples where officers might
                    come
                    across victims
                    include housing and homelessness services, community safety work, trading standards and licensing
                    services, social
                    services and customer services.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not an exhaustive list and there are many places where council staff and councillors may
                    come
                    across modern
                    slavery or trafficking. Councils should consider how best to ensure a joined-up approach to the
                    issues
                    across their
                    organisation
                </p>

                <h2>Modern Slavery Act 2015</h2>
                <p>
                    The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted" target="_blank">Modern
                        Slavery Act
                        2015</a> consolidated the current offences relating to trafficking and slavery and introduced a
                    range of new
                    measures around the prevention of modern slavery events and the support and protection of victims of
                    modern slavery.
                    Key aspects of the Act included:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>two new civil orders to prevent modern slavery</li>
                    <li>creating the role of Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner and its associated functions</li>
                    <li>the requirement for certain commercial businesses to produce transparency statements</li>
                    <li>provision for the support and protection of modern slavery victims.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Duty to notify and National Referral Mechanism (NRM)</h2>
                <p>Under the Act, local authorities have a duty to notify the Home Office of any individual encountered
                    in England and
                    Wales who they believe is a suspected victim of slavery or human trafficking.</p>

                <p>A range of Government <a
                        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-duty-to-notify"
                        target="_blank">resources</a> explain the meaning of ‘duty to notify' and explain what you need
                    to do if you
                    think someone has been a victim of modern slavery:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>how to notify the Government if someone has been a victim of modern slavery</li>
                    <li>the process for victims under 18</li>
                    <li>which forms should be filled in</li>
                    <li>what to do if the victim wants to remain anonymous.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The <a

                        target="_blank">NRM</a> is the process by which victims of modern slavery, including human
                    trafficking, are
                    recorded. The NRM was extended to all victims of modern slavery - both children and adults - in
                    England and
                    Wales following the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p>
                <p>
                    It was estimated that there were between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of modern slavery
                    in the UK in 2013
                    but in 2015, only 3,266 potential victims were identified and referred to the NRM. The Duty to
                    Notify is
                    intended to gather better data about modern slavery.</p>
